<h1>Alina Baraz and the Galamatias</h1>
<p>Alina Baraz and the Galamatias is an ecclectic band whose rythmic baselines and soothing melodies are inspired by the urban core. <br> Alina Baraz is the singer of the group while the Galamatias lend a supportive hand with instrumentals; focusing moreso on snares, snaps and synthesizers than on any particular instrument
